                            With mutual agreement, refunds will be made if delivery is delayed owing to small mechanical
                            issues, such as analytical, typing, word count, missing sources, etc. Amazon Publish Center will
                            only accept exchanges for partial refunds or future purchase-only discounts.

                        Reimbursements will be processed after mutual agreement, and the company will only settle with a
                        partial refund or discounts saved for future orders in the event of a late delivery caused by minor
                        technical faults like grammar, typing, word count, missing references, etc. Any delays brought on by
                        the client are not the responsibility of the firm.
